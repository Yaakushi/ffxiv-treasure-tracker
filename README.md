## TODO

- [ ] Find a good name for the project
- [ ] Fill out the Dalamud .JSON with actual plugin data
- [ ] Remove unneeded code from the SamplePlugin project
- [ ] Add a refresh button in the tracker window
- [ ] Find a way to track people digging their map or opening their treasure chest.
- [ ] Find a way to let people link the map for others without losing their own link?

## Wishlist for the future

- [ ] Make code not sucky.
- [ ] Show all flags on the map at the same time? That'd be kinda cool. (Thanks Gucci)
