## TODO

- [ ] Find a good name for the project
- [x] Fill out the Dalamud .JSON with actual plugin data
- [x] Remove unneeded code from the SamplePlugin project
- [x] Add a refresh button in the tracker window
- [x] Find a way to track people digging their map or opening their treasure chest
- [ ] Make the tracker window prettier
- [x] ~~Check if we really need a configuration window, since the might be nothing to configure?~~
- [ ] Add a button to manually reset/remove links from the plugin.
- [ ] Make the dig detector able to handle with i18n -- dig definitely isn't dig in german.
- [ ] Make an icon for the project?????????

## Wishlist for the future

- [ ] Make code not sucky.
- [ ] Show all flags on the map at the same time? That'd be kinda cool. (Thanks Gucci)
- [ ] Try to find a way to make the dig tracker more reliable? Right now, it will "fail" if someone '/ac dig' outside of where they are supposed to.
- [ ] Find a way to let people link the map for others without losing their own link?
